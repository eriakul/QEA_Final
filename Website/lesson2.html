    <p>Isn't the tuned-mass damper amazing? If you want to see the direct effects of a damper on a skyscraper, this video does a wonderful job illustrating it.</p>

    <p>Optimizing Taipei's structure to withstand both typhoon winds and earthquakes was no easy feat. A building that has <a href="http://global.ctbuh.org/resources/papers/download/1650-structural-design-of-taipei-101-the-worlds-tallest-building.pdf">
      "stiff enough form for wind drift does not automatically have the overload behavior desired for seismic ductility"</a>.
    Something the architects had to take into consideration was the building's ductility (elastic "spring" factor), its stiffness ("damping" factor), and
    the natural frequency at which the tower oscillates. Adding energy into a system at its natural frequency can create a lot of trouble.
    </p>

    <p>An earthquake with a frequency of $ω$ that matches Taipei 101's natural frequency would really cause the tower to crash and burn...
      This is purely hypothetical, of course! </p>


    <p>So, in our labs we're working to create a simplified model of the skyscraper and find its natural frequencies.</p>

    <p>Remember everything we taught you regarding springs and dampers?
      We can put all our previous calculations to use by modelling the building like this.</p>

    <div class="image-container long">
      <img src="assets/images/model.png" >
    </div>

    <p>In this model, the building is represented by discrete masses and the elasticity and stiffness of the building
    is represented by k and b respectively. The mass at the top of the model is the damper mass and $k_d$ represent the
    spring factor of the damper while $b_d$ represents the damping factor. The earthquake is represented by one-dimensional
    left and right displacements of the ground.</p>

    <p>For simplicity's sake, lets set the entire building to be one mass. The resulting system is exactly the one we saw earlier.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="assets/images/2massgraphic.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>In this system, $m_1$ is the mass of the tower and $m_2$ represents the damper mass. We will represent
    the earthquake as a sinusoidal force, $f = sin(ω t)$, that effects only $m_1$ directly.</p>

    <h3>Problem 1) Taking your solution <a href="lesson1.html">from earlier</a>, how would you make the equation take into account
    the additional force, $f = sin(ω t)$?</h3>

    <div class="image-container">
      <div class="answer-box" id = "p5">
        <p>You may recall from earlier that a one-mass spring damper system is represented by this equation.</p>
        $$ mx'' + kx + bx' = 0 $$
        <p>An additional external force can be included like this.</p>
        $$ mx'' + kx + bx' = f(t) $$
        <p>We add the force into the matrix system in the same way.</p>
        $$ [\table \1,  \0, \0, \0; \0, \1, \0, \0; \0, \0, \m_1, \0; \0, \0, \0, \m_2;] d/{dt}  [\table \x_1; \x_2; \v_1; \v_2] + [\table \0,  \0, \-1, \0; \0, \0, \0, \-1; \(k_1 + k_2), \-k_2, \(b_1 + b_2), \-b_2; \-k_2, \k_2, \-b_2, \b_2;] [\table \x_1; \x_2; \v_1; \v_2] = [\table \0;  \0; \f; \0] sin(ω t)$$
        <p>Given $v_1 = x_1'$ and $v_2 = x_2'$.</p>
