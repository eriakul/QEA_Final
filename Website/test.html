    <p>Consider this system.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The ODE of a mass, m, connected to a wall by a spring with spring constant k and a damper with damper constant b is</p>

    $$ mx'' = -kx - bx' $$

    <p>Reorganized, that is</p>

    $$ mx'' + kx + bx' = 0 $$

    <p>Now, consider a system that contains two masses coupled together to a wall with springs and dampers.</p>

        <p>There are a few ways you can solve this problem. One way is to use the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eig.html">eig() function</a> in Matlab. </p>
        <p>If you compare $M ω X = D X $ and $ λBx = Ax $, you'll notice that the scalar $ω$ corresonds to the scalar $λ$,
        the eigenvalues of the problem.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to solve for $ω$, the frequencies at which both masses are moving at the same frequency
           but not necessarily the same amplitudes. These frequencies are known as the system's <b>eigenfrequencies</b>.</p>
        <p>There are a few ways to format the code in Matlab, and your best resource is the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eig.html"">documentation</a>. Here's how
        we did it.</p>
        <code>
          syms  m_1  m_2  b_1  b_2  k_1  k_2;

          M = [ 1  0 0 0;
                0 1 0 0;
                0 0 m_1 0;
                0 0 0 m_2];

          D=[0 0 -1 0;
             0 0 0 -1;
             (k_1 + k_2) -k_2 (b_1 + b_2) -b_2;
             -k_2 k_2 -b_2 b_2];

          [eigenvectors, eigenvalues] = eig(D* inv( M))
        </code>
        <p>The eigenvectors we computed show the relationship between the positions and velocities of the
        two masses when they are oscillating in unison. These vectors are the <b>eigenmodes</b> of the system.</p>
        <p>The eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes are significant because it often corresponds to frequencies that add
        the most power into a system. Applying a force at the same frequency as a system's natural frequency is like
        pushing someone on a swing. If done at the right time, the person will swing higher and higher.</p>

    <h2>Taipei 101 and Earthquakes</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101">Taipei 101</a> is a skyscraper in Taipei, Taiwan. In 2010,
    it was the world's tallest skyscraper. The city, Taipei, is susceptible to earthquakes and typoons. The engineers and architects
    behind the construction of Taipei 101 had to take these external forces from nature into account for the towers structural
    integrity.</p>

    <p>One of the precautions they took was installing a tuned mass damper at the top of the building that dampens the
    oscillations caused by wind and earthquakes. Essentially, it is a giant weight suspended at the top of the tower. </p>

    <p>The Taipei 101 damper is one of the only skyscraper dampers viewable to the public and became a significant tourist attraction.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="Assets/Images/damper.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>The building even has its own mascots called the Damper Babies. The Damper Babies explain
    the function of the Taipei 101 tuned mass damper in this video. </p>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>

    <p>If you want to see the direct effects of a tuned-mass damper, this video does a wonderful job illustrating it.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1U4SAgy60c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Let's pretend to be the team of architects designing Taipei 101! Let's say that earthquakes in Taipei tend to have
    a frequency of $ω$. Our goal is to create a simplified model of the skyscraper and find its natural frequencies.</p>

    <p>We can put all our previous calculations to use by modelling the building like this.</p>

    <div class="image-container long">
      <img src="Assets/Images/model.png" >
    </div>

    <p>In this model, the building is represented by discrete masses and the elasticity and stiffness of the building
    is represented by k and b respectively. The mass at the top of the model is the damper mass and $k_d$ represent the
    spring factor of the damper while $b_d$ represents the damping factor. The earthquake is represented by one-dimensional
    left and right displacements of the ground.</p>

    <p>For simplicity's sake, lets set the entire building to be one mass. The resulting system is exactly the one we saw earlier.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="Assets/Images/2massgraphic.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>In this system, $m_1$ is the mass of the tower and $m_2$ represents the damper mass. We will represent
    the earthquake as a sinusoidal force, $f = sin(ω t)$, that effects only $m_1$ directly.</p>

    <h3>Problem 5) Taking your solution from problem 2, how would you make the equation take into account
    the additional force, $f = sin(ω t)$?</h3>
